# Eclypse E-commerce Webpage Clone

👋 Hi Tenidhar and Team,

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this assignment. I’ve recreated the basic e-commerce webpage as per the provided Figma designs using **React**, **TailwindCSS**, **TypeScript**, and **Node.js**. The project is structured with clean, modular code and includes responsive layouts, functional components, and a basic Node backend serving dummy data.
